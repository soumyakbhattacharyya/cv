      3. what does CMD signifies (command that start used as default command to start the container)
      4. how to create tags (--tags <REPOSITORY>:<TAG>)
      5. how to see various layers of docker images (docker image history)
      6. how to copy file from local machine to the docker image (COPY)
      7. what is the difference between COPY and ADD (COPY does not support tar and remote url)
      8. how to declare constants in a Dockerfile (ARG)
      9. what is the linux distribution that we should use in order to attain a small image size (alpine-linux)
      10. which command is used to login to DockerHub (docker login)
   7. Docker Network Manipulation
      1. how many networking drivers does docker have (5)
      2. what is bridge network type (default mode; multiple containers communicate with each other)
      3. what is host network (the containers shares host network; no network isolation)
      4. what is none network (no network for the containers)
      5. what is overlay network (network to connect multiple docker daemon)
      6. what is macvlan (containers get mac address)
      7. what is user defined bridge network (custom network, provides isolation)
      8. how to connect to a user defined bridge network (docker network connect <NETWORK> <CONTAINER>)
2. Docker Compose
   1. what is predecessor of docker compose (fig)
   2. what is the format of dc file (version, services, networks, volumes)
   3. what is the default networking for dc (bridge)
   4. what does build attribute of service signifies (the Dockerfile to build from)
   5. what does command attribute of service signifies (how to run)
   6. what does ports attribute signifies (the port to expose to the bridge)
   7. what does networks attribute signifies (the network to run the service against)
   8. what does the volume attribute signifies (the volume shared across multiple containers)
   9. does the volume created by dc gets automatically deleted (no)
   10. what is the command to see all running containers by dc (docker service ls)
3. Docker Swarm
   1. what are 2 modes of swarm (cluster and orchestration)
   2. what is swarm node (any machine with docker)
   3. what are node types (manager and worker)
   4. where does swarm configuration stays (in memory etcd)
   5. what is service from docker swarm perspective (containers wrapped with enhance features)
   6. what is the port to support secure client to swarm communication (2377/tcp)
   7. what is the port to support control plane gossip (7946/tcp and udp)
   8. what is the port to support VXLAN-based overlay network (4789/udp)
   9. what is --advertise-addr flag while initializing swarm being used for (publish endpoint)
   10. what is --listen-addr flag while initializing swarm being used for (accept traffic)
   11. what is the default port of advertisement (2379)
   12. what is the command to join a new worker to the swarm 
       1. get join token using - docker swarm join-token worker
       2. use the join token to join - docker swarm join --token <TOKEN> <MANAGER:2377>
   13. what is the command to join a new manager to the swarm
       1. get join token using - docker swarm join-token manager
       2. use the join token to join - docker swarm join --token <TOKEN> <MANAGER:2377> 
   14. what is the state of swarm managers (active-passive)
   15. what is the recommended number of managers (3/5)
   16. what is split brain problem (even number of managers lose right of owning the quorum if partitioned in exact half)
   17. what is locking of swarm (to avoid accidental access of old managers while they rejoin swarm, the swarm can be autolocked, so that the old manager has to pass unloack key before joining swarm)
   18. what is docker service (an unit managed by swarm)
   19. what is the way to initialize a service (docker service create --name --port --replicas <IMAGE_NAME>)
   20. what is the command to list all services (docker service ls)
   21. what is the command to see all the processes next to a service (docker service ps <SERVICE_NAME>)
   22. what is the command to see the state of service (docker service inspect <SERVICE_NAME>)
   23. what is the way to scale a specific service (docker service scale <SERVICE_NAME>=10)
   24. how to remove a service (docker service rm <SERVICE_NAME>)
   25. how to perform rolling update (docker service update --image <NEW_IMAGE> --update-parallelism 2 --update-delay 20s <SERVICE_NAME>)
   26. how to tail docker service log (docker service logs <SERVICE_NAME)
   27. what is the default log driver for docker swarm (json-file)
   28. what are few of the supported log drivers (splunk, syslog)
   29. what is the premises of log driver (assuming the container to be running as PID1 the STDERR and STDOUT are routed to respective log location, as defined by the driver)
   30. which directory needs to be backed up for docker swarm (/var/lib/docker/swarm)
   31. what is the flag that needs to be passed to restore the docker swarm (--force-new-cluster)
